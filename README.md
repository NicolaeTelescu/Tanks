# Tanks

## Presentation
**Tanks** is a multiplayer online 2D game with tanks. The focus is on *player vs player* gameplay with each player controlling a tank.

The project has two parts: **client side** and **server side**. For the client side I use mainly Javascript and HTML and for the server side I use Node.JS. I also use:
- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) - JavaScript library for realtime web applications 
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) - professional quality vector graphics software
- [WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/Main_Page) - JavaScript API for rendering 2D and 3D graphics
